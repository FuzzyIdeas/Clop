# 3.2.0

**[Download Clop 3.2.0 →](https://files.lowtechguys.com/releases/Clop-3.2.0.dmg)**
## Build and assign pipelines in one place

The Pipelines tab is where you create automations now, not just review them.

- **New pipeline** starts one from scratch and opens it for editing.
- **Use in…** assigns a saved pipeline to the clipboard, the drop zone, or a watched folder, so you stop rebuilding the same steps in different places. A generic "any type" pipeline can target one file type or all of them.
- Built-in pipelines are marked, and an assignment whose pipeline was deleted shows a **Missing** tag instead of quietly running a stale copy.
- The two per-pipeline switches have text labels and hover descriptions: *Pass optimised file* or *Pass original file*, and *Show floating result* or *Hide floating result*.

## Clearer automation

- The clipboard and drop-zone rows read **Clipboard** and **Drop zone**, each with a line saying it runs on every file of that type you copy or drop. That is separate from Preset Zones, which now have a link from here.
- The Clipboard and Drop Zone settings panes each gained an **Automation** section, so you can add, edit and remove their pipelines right where you set them up.

## One result card per pipeline

A pipeline updates a single result card as it runs, instead of replacing it with a new card at every step.

- Steps that don't produce a previewable file (copy a link, copy to clipboard, run a script, move or delete) keep the last thumbnail along with its size, resolution and bitrate, rather than blanking the card.
- A new `fork` step peels off a second result you can drag out while the pipeline keeps going, so `optimise -> fork -> convert(to: webp)` hands you both files. Without a location the fork stays in a temp folder; give it one to save it somewhere.
- A pipeline that has nothing to change (a file already at the target size) still shows the file with its size and resolution, so a drop never looks like it did nothing.

## Command line

- `clop pipeline list` reads in plain language: every entry is tagged as built-in, your own, or a reference, with **Skip optimisation** and **Hide result** spelled out. Automations for folders you no longer watch, plus empty or broken ones, are hidden; `--all` shows them.
- `clop pipeline run` takes `--show-result` and `--hide-result` to match the rest of the tool, and `--gui` still works.
- `clop pipeline prompt` is rewritten to cover when to skip optimisation, that converting to a format the file already is does nothing, how `if`/`ifNot` filters behave, and how to avoid encoding a file twice.

## Fixes

- `clop strip-exif` works again instead of failing to find its bundled tools
- Converting an image to the format it's already in no longer re-encodes it, so `.jpg` files (and crop-then-convert pipelines) stop losing quality to a needless extra pass

## Improvements

- The `clop` command-line tool returns an error code only when every file failed, so a partial success doesn't make retry scripts reprocess files that already worked

# 3.1.0

**[Download Clop 3.1.0 →](https://files.lowtechguys.com/releases/Clop-3.1.0.dmg)**
## Batch mode

Drop a folder or a big pile of files and Clop opens a dedicated window built for thousands of files, without a floating card for each one.

![The batch optimisation window](https://files.lowtechguys.com/clop-3.1.0-batch.png)

Before anything runs, each original is cloned to a safe backup, so you can re-compress the whole set with different settings or roll it all back.

Drop a folder with more files than the threshold you set in Settings and it opens here automatically. You can also open it from the menubar and drag files in.

## Redesigned floating results

Every optimised file is now a thumbnail card, audio included, with album cover art when the file has it. Hover a card for its action buttons, or press `Space` to QuickLook it.

![Floating results for an image, video, PDF and audio file](https://files.lowtechguys.com/clop-3.1.0-floating-results.png)

## Pick files in the compact list

Click a hover checkbox to start selecting, then click any row to add it. A bar appears for the whole set: a handle to drag them all out, plus save, crop, downscale, bitrate and more. `⌘A` selects all, `Esc` clears.

![Selecting files in the compact list](https://files.lowtechguys.com/clop-3.1.0-compact-results.png)

## Audio

Audio gets first-class controls this release.

- **Cover art**: choose whether embedded art is optimised, removed, or left untouched, instead of always being dropped. Optimising recompresses it at aggressive settings while keeping its resolution, so it stops bloating the file.
- **Extract cover art** as its own image result, ready to save or drag out, and **downscale** it with a slider that shows the target resolution as you drag.
- **Loudness normalisation**: even out volume to a target (Streaming, Apple Music, Podcast, Broadcast).
- **Speed up audio**: the playback speed change now works on audio files, not just video.
- **Compression slider**: one percentage trades quality for size, with the resulting bitrate shown as you move it.
- **Compare (A/B)**: play the original and the optimised version back to back.

![Comparing the original and optimised audio side by side](https://files.lowtechguys.com/clop-3.1.0-audio-compare.png)

## Edit with external app

Hand an optimised file to an editor of your choice with `⌘E` or the right-click menu. Pick a per-type app in Settings, for example Pixelmator Pro for images, LosslessCut for video, or Audacity for audio.

![Edit with external app setting](https://files.lowtechguys.com/clop-3-1-0-edit-external-app.png)

## New menubar icon

A fresh default menubar icon, with a picker if you'd rather keep the classic one or switch to the flat geometric style.

![Menubar icon styles](https://files.lowtechguys.com/clop-3-1-0-menubar-icon-selector.png)

## Secure send link expiration

Choose how long a "Send securely" link stays alive, from `1m` up to `3d`, or never. Set it as you send (a slider on the floating result, a popover in compact mode), or change it later from the live link button.

![Send securely link expire](https://files.lowtechguys.com/clop-3-1-0-send-link-expire.png)

## More for power users

- **Inline pipeline scripts**: run shell commands straight from a step with `runScript(code: "sips -Z 800 $1")`, no separate script file needed.
- **`clop pipeline prompt`**: print a paste-ready reference of the whole pipeline language for an AI assistant, then describe a task and get a working pipeline back. Add `-c` to copy it to the clipboard.

## Fixes

- `--copy` always copies a file path, even when optimisation or conversion fails (it copies the original), so you get back as many files as you put in
- *Optimised file location* is respected when re-optimising from the floating result
- The close (x) button reliably dismisses a floating result
- Audio bitrate is never raised above the file's original, even when the configured bitrate is higher
- Aggressive optimisation on audio steps the bitrate down a level instead of doing nothing
- Files worked on with an `Option`-drag copy keep their real name instead of a temporary `clop-dropzone-…` name
- The Cmd-minus on hover hotkey now lowers PDF resolution and audio bitrate, instead of only flashing the value
- Restoring the original clears the stale size, bitrate and resolution comparison
- The downscale button no longer looks disabled for WebP, HEIC, AVIF and TIFF images
- PDF results no longer show a second, greyed-out compression button next to the working one
- The "drag all" handle works again instead of grabbing the result above it, and shows a stack of file thumbnails
- Dragging a single result shows its thumbnail instead of a plain dark rectangle
- The filename on an audio result is centred at its natural width instead of stretching across the card

## Improvements

- The filename on a card grows to full width and shrinks to fit while you hover it, so long names stay readable
- Audio results show the cover art resolution under the bitrate
- Launching Clop while it's already running opens Settings
- The drop zone preview in Settings scrolls, and includes audio preset zones
- Menubar menu hides keyboard shortcut hints for actions whose hotkeys are turned off
- The compact result list stays smooth with many results and shows the space saved as a percentage, matching the batch window
- Selecting files in the compact list keeps your single-file actions and never reshuffles the list out from under you

# 3.0.0

**[Download Clop 3.0.0 →](https://files.lowtechguys.com/releases/Clop-3.0.0.dmg)**
## Audio optimisation

Clop now handles audio files: `WAV`, `FLAC`, `AIFF`, high-bitrate `MP3`s.

Drop audio files and Clop converts them to `AAC`, `MP3` or `Opus` at a bitrate you pick. `WAV` downsizing is also possible if the decoder supports `adpcm` encoding.

*New **Audio** tab in Settings for watched folders, output format, bitrate and skip rules.*

## Drop zone at cursor

Tap `⌥ Option` to show the drop zone below your cursor. Tap again to dismiss.

No need to drag files across the screen to reach a corner.

## Video encoder picker

The old *Aggressive / CPU-intensive* toggles are now a single picker:

- **Fast, battery efficient, larger file** -- hardware encoder, almost no CPU usage
- **Slow, high quality, smaller file** -- software encoder, high CPU usage
- **Visually lossless** -- best quality, largest files

## Collect clipboard results

New setting to collect all clipboard optimisation results instead of always replacing the last one.

Every image you copy gets optimised and added to a list. Paste them all at once into apps that accept multiple files.

There's also a new drag handle that can drag all results at once.

## PDF pages as images

Right-click a PDF result to extract its pages as optimised JPEG or PNG files.

Single-page PDFs get a **Convert to image** option that creates a new draggable result. Multi-page PDFs get **Extract pages as images** which saves all pages to a folder you choose, with a progress bar on the PDF result.

## Send files securely

Share any optimised file over an encrypted peer-to-peer connection. No upload, no server storage, unlimited size.

Click **Send file securely** from the right-click menu or the side button, and a link is copied to your clipboard. The receiver opens the link in a browser and downloads directly from your Mac over WebRTC. The link stays active until you stop it or quit Clop.

Active sends appear in the menubar menu where you can copy the link again or stop individual sends.

## Configurable action buttons

The side buttons on floating and compact results can now be rearranged and customised. Add, remove or reorder actions from Settings.

## JPEG XL support

Clop can now read and write JPEG XL files. Drop a JPEG XL file to convert it to a more widely supported format, or export an optimised image as JPEG XL for maximum quality and compression. The resulting file will have the `.jxl` extension.

## AV1 video support

Clop can now read and write AV1 video files. Drop an AV1 file to convert it to a more widely supported format, or convert any format to AV1 for maximum quality and compression.

AV1 does not have its own file extension, I decided to use the MKV container for AV1 encoding to make it easily distinguishable from the more common H.264 and HEVC formats that use MP4. The resulting file will have the `.mkv` extension.

## Pipelines, Automation and more powerful presets

Every action done by Clop is now part of a fully editable pipeline with steps like `optimise`, `convert`, `downscale` etc.

This allows us to always work on the original file and avoid double encoding and losing quality. It also makes backups more resilient to encoder failures.

### Automation

The fiddly Shortcuts approach for automation was replaced with a pipeline editor that can do things like:

- `on image arriving in ~/Desktop/lowtechguys`
    - -> `crop(width: 1600)` -> `optimise(encoder: lossless)`
        - -> `copy(to: "~/lowtechguys/img")` -> `convert(to: webp, location: sameFolder)`
- `on video copied to clipboard`
    - -> `crop(width: 1200)` -> `optimise(encoder: fast, location: tempFolder)`
        - -> `copyLinkForSending()`
- `on PDF arriving in ~/Downloads`
    - `if(nameContains: "invoice")` -> `copy(to: "~/Documents/Invoices/%y-%m-%d_%f")`
        - `extractPagesAsImages(format: jpeg, quality: medium, location: sameFolder)`

### Presets

Same idea for presets, they're no longer limited to running Shortcuts. They can run full pipelines which are also saved in a library for reuse in automation if needed.

Making a Preset Zone that converts the dropped image to `webp` is as simple as writing `convert(to: webp)`.

## PDF DPI control

PDF optimisation DPI can now be adjusted:

- The minus button on a PDF result opens a slider with stops at `300`, `250`, `200`, `150`, `100`, `72` and `48` DPI
    - Drag to re-run the optimisation at the chosen DPI.
- Aggressive optimisation uses **adaptive** DPI by default
    - Clop inspects the image resolutions inside each PDF and picks a DPI that compresses the most without visibly hurting quality
    - Pick a fixed value from the slider or the **PDF** settings to opt out.
- Two new settings under **PDF** let you set the default DPI for normal and aggressive optimisation
    - `300` means no downsampling.
- Pipelines accept a `dpi` parameter on the optimise step, e.g. `optimise(dpi: 150)`.

## Parallel PDF optimisation

Large PDFs (larger than 150 pages) will be split into PDFs of 100 pages and optimisation will run in parallel on those splits. This should make PDF optimisation 4x faster on large PDFs and fix cases where it might not work on >200 pages.

## Hidden results without losing the drop zone

Floating results are now optional in more places, without taking the drop zone with them.

- **Per watched folder**, toggle floating results off in the watch paths lists. Optimisation still runs, the result just doesn't pop up
- **Per pipeline**, the new `hideResult` flag lets an automation copy a file, run a Shortcut, or send something silently
- The **drop zone keeps working** even when floating results are disabled globally

## Ignore clipboard from specific apps

A new **Ignored apps** list under clipboard settings blocks selected apps from triggering optimisation.

## Improvements

- **Re-optimise with encoder...** submenu for videos, replacing the old aggressive toggle
- Dragging files from results now provides the real file path instead of a SwiftUI temp file
- Add a **Reset** button for the working directory path
- Optimised images copied to clipboard no longer trigger a second optimisation pass
- Settings now use a sidebar list instead of the old top tab bar
- Fall back to native resizing when `vipsthumbnail` fails so downscaling no longer errors out

There is now a way to set where the optimised files will be placed:

- **Temporary folder**: they will be placed in the system temp folder that gets cleaned up periodically by the system
- **In-place (replace original)**: the default, moves the original file into Clop's backup folder and replaces it with the optimised file
- **Same folder (as original)**: places the optimised file alongside the original, renaming it based on the configured template
- **Specific folder**: places the optimised file in a specific path anywhere on disk, configured with a template

<video controls src="https://files.lowtechguys.com/clop-optimised-file-location-release-demo.mp4" width=481></video>

## Flexible template paths for the `--output` CLI

When using commands like `clop optimise --output <some path>`, the output path now uses the new templating engine.

To understand this better, here are some examples when resizing the PNG files on Desktop using something like:

```css
# the command is being run from ~/Documents/
~/Documents ❯ clop crop --size 1600x900 --output <template> ~/Desktop/screenshots/*.png
```

... where `<template>` can be:

- `resized_to_%z` -> path relative to current dir, places files in `~/Documents/resized_to_1600x900/`
- `~/Pictures/twitter/%f_%z.%e` -> absolute path, files will get paths like `~/Pictures/twitter/shot_1600x900.png`
- `%P/../twitter/` -> path relative to image dir, places files in `~/Desktop/twitter/`


## Features

- Use the new **[Jpegli](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2024/04/introducing-jpegli-new-jpeg-coding-library.html?hnid=39920644)** perceptive encoder from Google for even smaller JPEG images
- Update `ffmpeg` to version 7.0 for better video encoding
- Allow configuring the location where Clop stores temporary files and backups and when to clean up files
- Allow disabling floating results UI
- The global `Ctrl-Shift-P` hotkey can now toggle between:
    - **Running**: Clop is listening to clipboard and file events
    - **Paused**: Clop is paused for the next clipboard/file event and will resume automatically
    - **Stopped**: All automatic optimisations are stopped until manually resumed by user


## Improvements

- Add `--adaptive-optimisation` and `--no-adaptive-optimisation` options to CLI commands that can act on images
- Speed up PNG optimisation by using `pngquant`'s `--speed 3` option
- Improve EXIF metadata handling when optimising images and videos
- Detect files that are in progress of being created/modified and wait for the operation to settle before optimising

## Fixes

- Fix automation not triggering shortcuts for videos and PDFs
- Fix: if a previously optimised file was replaced with a new file, an old backup was being used for optimisations instead of the new file

## Features

### **Upload with [Dropshare](https://dropshare.app/)**

You can now upload optimised files to any cloud or server using [the Dropshare app](https://dropshare.app/).

Hover over the floating Clop result and press `Cmd`-`U` (or right click and choose *Upload with Dropshare*) to send the file to Dropshare.

![upload with dropshare option](https://files.lowtechguys.com/clop_2023-10-17_498.png)

Dropshare also integrates Clop directly, so if you use it to take screenshots, you can now have them optimised automatically before uploading.

*the feature is only in the beta version of Dropshare at the moment of this update*

![dropshare integration with clop](https://files.lowtechguys.com/clop_2023-10-17_499.png)

### [Clop SDK](https://github.com/FuzzyIdeas/ClopSDK)

You can now optimise images, videos and PDFs in your own app using the Clop SDK.

Example code:

*Swift*
```swift
import ClopSDK

guard ClopSDK.shared.waitForClopToBeAvailable() else {
    print("Clop is not available")
    return
}

try ClopSDK.shared.optimise(path: "AppData/image.png")
```

*Objective-C*
```objc
@import ClopSDK;

ClopSDKObjC *clop = [ClopSDKObjC shared];
if (![clop waitForClopToBeAvailableFor:5]) {
    return;
}

[clop optimiseWithPath:@"AppData/img.png" error:nil];
```


*This is not exactly a feature inside Clop, but I thought it might be a good idea to let people know in case someone is an app developer and wants to integrate Clop in their app.*

                          The shorter edge will be calculated automatically while keeping the original aspect ratio.

                          Example: `clop crop --long-edge --size 1920` will crop a landscape 2400x1350 image to 1920x1080, and a portrait 1350x2400 image to 1080x1920
