## Improvements

    - This setting can still be enabled manually in the **Images** tab of the **Settings** window
- Detect the correct number of Media Engine video encode cores
- Extract more metadata from videos when copying EXIF data between them
- Use a timeout of 5 seconds on xattrs instead of letting the app hang indefinitely

## Fixes

- Fix memory leaks and improve performance on batch processing
- Fix missing DPI and color profile metadata from optimised JPEGs
