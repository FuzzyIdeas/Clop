## Improvements

- **Compact Results** re-styling: better contrast and more visual organization
- Allow *already optimised* files to be dropped for subsequent actions (cropping, downscaling, uploading etc.)
- Create an image pile when dragging them to the drop zone
- Follow *Converted image location* setting for adaptive optimisation on PNG and JPEG
    - If `in-place` is selected, PNGs will be **replaced** with JPEGs if smaller, and vice-versa

## Fixes

- Fix app hang when sharing a file
- Fix settings window appearing on NSService action when menubar icon is hidden

## Coming soon..

- Better image compression with `webp` and `avif` outputs
- Raycast extension and Alfred workflow
