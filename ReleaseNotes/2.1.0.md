## Improvements

- Better scoring formula for video adaptive optimisation *(should result in less CPU usage on high workload videos)*
- Easier to read text on floating results

## Fixes

- **Optimising clipboard data should now leave the original files untouched**
- Fix GIF optimisation
- Fix resolution being 72x higher on JPEGs without a defined DPI
- Bringing back removed results would also bring back notices and error messages
- Destroy previously removed results after a while to free up memory
