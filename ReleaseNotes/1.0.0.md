Completely free version before the Pro features were introduced. Suitable for people who liked the simplicity and lack of customization of this version.

## Features:

- Watch the clipboard for `.png`, `.jpeg` and `.gif` images *(not paths, it had to be image data)*
- Ignore copied data coming from most graphical editors
- Optimize the images and copy them back to the clipboard
- Show a simple notification with the size savings in the bottom right corner of the screen
