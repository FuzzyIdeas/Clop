Introducing **Clop Pro**: freemium with an **$8** paid tier as a one-time purchase.

Still fully open source as GPLv3 for anyone to tinker with it.

## Features in **v2**:

- **Video optimisation** using the hardware encoder *(uses the dedicated Media Engine chip on Apple Silicon for little to no CPU usage)*
- **Downscale** images and videos on the fly
- **Hotkeys** for useful actions
	- Downscale to any percentage from `10%` to `90%` with a single keystroke
	- Restore original image/video
	- Quicklook the last optimised item
	- Pause optimiser for next copy
	- Optimise current clipboard if it's an URL/file path/ignored image etc.
- **Path watching**: optimise any file created inside configured folders
- **Floating thumbnails**: make it easy to see which item was optimised and allow interactions like:
	- Drag and drop the thumbnail anywhere to insert it
	- Swipe to dismiss
	- Buttons for Quicklook, Restore, Downscale etc.
- **URL optimisation**: download and optimise images and videos from links
- **macOS Shortcuts** support
- **Aggressive optimization** for squeezing more bits when needed
