## Features

* Add support for `--long-edge` flag to `clop crop` command

```bash
  -l, --long-edge         When the size is specified as a single number, it will crop the longer of width or height to that number.
                          The shorter edge will be calculated automatically while keeping the original aspect ratio.

                          Example: `clop crop --long-edge --size 1920` will crop a landscape 2400x1350 image to 1920x1080, and a portrait 1350x2400 image to 1080x1920
```
