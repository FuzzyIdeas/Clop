## Features

- PDF optimisation
- Strip EXIF metadata
- Auto Copy to clipboard for *dropped* and *watched* files after optimisation
- Settings sync between Macs via iCloud

## Improvements

- Skip optimisations when more than 1 file is copied to clipboard

- Make aggressive GIF optimisation more space saving by limiting colors to 256
- Implement optimisation on dropped file promises
- Better handling of optimisations that result in larger files
- Cleanup of optimiser processes on crash or forced termination


## Fixes

- Fix params for aggressive video optimisation
